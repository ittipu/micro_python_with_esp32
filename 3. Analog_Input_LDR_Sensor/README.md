Description: How to input analog value in Esp32 using micro python

Component use:
1. ESP32
2. LDR sensor
3. 1 KΩ resistor
4. Breadboard
5. Connecting Wire
6. Micro-USB cable for uploading Code to ESP32
7. Thonny IDE install on pc

Pin Diagram  - 
1. LDR any leg connect to 3.3V.
2. LDR other leg connect to a 1 KΩ resistor.
3. Connect the other resistor leg to ground.
4. Connect a connecting wire to ldr-resistor leg to D34 pin of ESP32.
