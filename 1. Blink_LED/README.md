<p>The blinking LED project in the embedded system is like hello-world in other programming languages.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The experiment we'll build consists of simply blinking a led with ESP32 NodeMCU development board. We use GPIO 23 of ESP32 Board for connecting the LED.<br> The blinking LED project works as follows: 
<ol>
<li>The LED turns on for 1 second</li>
<li>The LED turns off for 1 second</li>
<li>The LED turns on again for 1 second</li>
<li>The LED turns off again for 1 second</li>
<li>This will continues until you tell the program to stop.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Component Use:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>ESP32</li>
<li>330 Ohm resistor</li>
<li>a LED</li>
<li>Connecting Wire</li>
<li>Thonny IDE (I am using Ubuntu 20.04)</li>
</ol>
